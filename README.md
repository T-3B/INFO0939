# INFO 0939 - High Performance Scientific Computing
This project was done by HANSEN Julien and SMAGGHE Cl√©ment.

To test this project, a simple `make -j` will build all targets, that are:
- serial (mono-CPU, with fixed code for better cache utilization)
- omp
- mpi
- mpi_omp (hybrid)
- gpu

Note that we chose to implement transparent boundary conditions (available with `param.source_type = 3`) and Coriolis forces (used on every `param.source_type`).
